Two-player competitive brick-stacker where your bricks are the
other player's empty space.

Controls
--------

ESDF and IJKL. Or whatever keys are in those QWERTY positions,
because apparently browsers have scancodes now? Cool.

P pauses and unpauses the game.


ToDo
----

Maybe make it show a shadow where your piece would land if you dropped it?
